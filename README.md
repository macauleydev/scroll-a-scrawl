# scroll-a-scrawl

Scroll-a-Scrawl is a web app I made while working through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Full Stack Ruby on Rails path.

I liked the [idea](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch) of creating something inspired by Etch-a-Sketch, but I modified the suggested guidelines to make my app more closely resemble the experience of drawing with an Etch-a-Sketch, which I remember to be far more awkward and less controllable than moving a mouse.

Therefore, in Scroll-a-Scrawl, you draw by spinning the mouse wheel (similar to turning the knobs of an Etch-a-Sketch). The drawing angle can be modified by holding modifier keys.

I equally enjoyed the challenges of:
- implementing the logic (including the ability to zoom without clearing the canvas),
- optimizing for user experience (as described above, but also with respect to behavior of modifier keys), and
- designing the user interface (including the CSS compass, colors, typography, and copy).

In the future, I hope to add support for touch-based scrolling on mobile. Meanwhile, please enjoy it from a computer!
